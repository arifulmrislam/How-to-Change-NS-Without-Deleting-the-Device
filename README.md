How to change the NS without deleting the device from the previous one?

For some reason, if we want to change the network server of devices. We can manage it by Downlink commands. 
In this case, we must delete the device from the NS. But if we delete the device from NS, we will lose control of the device. As like LR3 LoRaWAN water meter. 
So, how to change the NS? 
By the way, when we send the downlink commands to the device before that we will edit or change the application key from device settings. 
Devise will try to the region again and it will connect with the new NS, not the previous one.
